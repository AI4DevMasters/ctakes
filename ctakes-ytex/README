Need buildhelper m2e plugin

== Developing ==
YTEX is driven by a property file, ytex.properties.  The property file used when running ytex java programs 
(aside from junit tests) is src\main\resources\org\apache\ctakes\ytex\ytex.properties.  Create this file
for use when running java programs.

YTEX relies on some config files generated from templates via an ant build script.  These config files are 
generated automatically by the maven build (which runs the ant build script).  
M2E is a bit (understatement) buggy, you may have to run the maven
build from the command line so that things work correctly.

== Testing ==

YTEX is dependent upon a database which is set up by the ant script scripts\data\build.xml

Note that all ytex-related tables in these databases will be dropped and recreated every time 
the maven build is run (don't put data you want to keep there).
  
Maven runs the ant script prior to running the tests. 
By default, we set up an hsqldb database for testing in the TEMP dir.
Override this by:
 * passing -Ddb.type=[mysql|mssql|orcl] to the maven command line.  If you do that,
 we will use the \src\test\resources\org\apache\ctakes\ytex\ytex.${db.type}.properties
 which point to the ytex_test schema (mysql/orcl) or catalog (mssql).
 * or dropping your own ytex.properties in 
 \src\test\resources\org\apache\ctakes\ytex.
